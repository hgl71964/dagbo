BUILD:

as of hiBench version 29224b9c

build with java 8: sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk

maven version: 3.2.5

apache spark version 2.4.5

apacha hadoop version 2.7.7

CONFIG DIR:

1. {hadoop home}/etc/hadoop
2. {hibench home}/conf

FAILUER:

Spark Bench:

GENERALLY, rebuild Hibench & restart all services

1. fail to launch because container run beyond virtual memory limit,

it could be a problem for java 8
this is found from log -> {hadoop home}/logs/yarn-gh512-resourcemanager

solutions:
        we have the minimum RAM for a Container (yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb) = 2 GB
        this is configurable in {hadoop home}/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml

        I simply set executor memory = 6g (2 executors) solve the problem
